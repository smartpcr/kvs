# Reference Implementation: Deployment Orchestration with KVS

This document outlines a sample approach for using **KVS** to orchestrate deployment of software components across a data center. The system is composed of multiple microservices running in either Kubernetes or a Windows Failover Cluster. KVS provides consistent state management via a distributed keyâ€‘value store with Raft-based consensus.

## Clustered KVS Store
- Deploy a multi-node KVS cluster with the provided cluster configuration template.
- Each node participates in Raft consensus for leader election and log replication.
- Health monitoring and automatic failover ensure continuous availability.

## Software Component Registry
- Use KVS collections to store metadata for software components, including version, download URL, checksum, and deployment state.
- Updates are replicated to a quorum before acknowledgement, preventing data loss even when many machines modify state concurrently.

## Deployment Services
- Microservices for update discovery and installation connect to the cluster through the **ClusterAwareClient**.
- Reads may target any healthy node, while writes go through the leader to maintain strong consistency.
- Timestamps or transaction IDs can be included in the data model to track volatile state changes.

## Update Discovery via Manifest URIs
- Software vendors host a manifest at a well-known URI that describes the latest available version of their component.
- Vendors establish a trust relationship with the update service (e.g., signed manifests or API keys) so the discovery service can securely retrieve these manifests.
- The discovery service stores retrieved manifests in KVS along with metadata about available updates.
- KVS collections track which deployments have consumed an update and record the state of ongoing installations across the cluster.

## Scalability and Reliability
- KVS offers linear read scalability with quorum-based writes.
- Failover typically completes in under one second, and WAL-based recovery returns nodes to service within ten seconds of a crash.
- Health checks and metrics (e.g., replication lag, election events) allow monitoring of ongoing deployments.

## End-to-End Testing
- Follow documented integration and chaos tests to validate cluster behavior under failure conditions such as leader loss or network partitions.
- Execute stress and performance tests to verify scaling characteristics and ensure reliability under heavy load.

By leveraging the clustering capabilities of KVS and rigorous testing, this reference implementation provides a scalable and reliable foundation for managing frequent software updates across numerous machines.
