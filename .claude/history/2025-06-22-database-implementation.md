# Session: Database Implementation - 2025-06-22

## Summary
Created core database implementation with DatabaseEngine and KvsDatabase classes, implementing transaction support, query execution, and database management functionality.

## Work Completed

### 1. Database Engine Implementation
- Created `src/Kvs.Core/Database/DatabaseEngine.cs`
  - Core database management with transaction support
  - ACID properties implementation
  - Query execution framework
  - Integration with storage engine and indexing

### 2. KvsDatabase Public API
- Created `src/Kvs.Core/Database/KvsDatabase.cs`
  - Public-facing database interface
  - Simplified API for common operations
  - Transaction management wrapper
  - Database lifecycle management

### 3. Unit Tests
- Created comprehensive test suites:
  - `DatabaseEngineTests.cs` - Core engine functionality
  - `KvsDatabaseTests.cs` - Public API testing
  - Transaction tests including rollback scenarios
  - Concurrent access testing
  - Query execution tests

### 4. Key Features Implemented
- **Transactions**: Begin, Commit, Rollback with isolation
- **CRUD Operations**: Put, Get, Delete with transactional support
- **Query Support**: Range queries with index optimization
- **Database Management**: Create, Open, Close, Delete databases
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception handling
- **Thread Safety**: Concurrent transaction support

## Technical Details

### Architecture
- DatabaseEngine: Core implementation with direct storage/index access
- KvsDatabase: High-level wrapper providing simplified API
- Transaction isolation using in-memory buffers
- Write-ahead logging integration for durability

### Testing Coverage
- All 260 tests passing (100% success rate)
- Phase 1: Storage Engine (81 tests)
- Phase 2: Data Structures (98 tests)
- Phase 3: Database Implementation (81 tests)

## Next Steps
- Phase 4: Query Processing
  - Query parser implementation
  - Query optimizer
  - Advanced query operations
  - Performance optimization

## Files Modified
- Created: `src/Kvs.Core/Database/DatabaseEngine.cs`
- Created: `src/Kvs.Core/Database/KvsDatabase.cs`
- Created: `src/Kvs.Core.UnitTests/Database/DatabaseEngineTests.cs`
- Created: `src/Kvs.Core.UnitTests/Database/KvsDatabaseTests.cs`
- Updated: `CLAUDE.md` to reflect Phase 3 completion

## Build Status
✅ Build successful - 0 warnings, 0 errors
