# Session: Serializable Isolation Deadlock Fix
Date: 2025-06-23

## Issue
Test failure in `IsolationTests.Serializable_ShouldPreventNonRepeatableReads` with DeadlockException.

## Root Cause
The lock manager wasn't checking if a transaction already held a read lock before blocking on pending write requests. This created a false deadlock scenario:
1. Txn1 reads doc1 (gets read lock)
2. Txn2 tries to write doc1 (blocks, waits for Txn1's read lock)
3. Txn1 tries to read doc1 again - blocked by pending write from Txn2
4. Deadlock: Txn1 waiting for Txn2's pending write, Txn2 waiting for Txn1's read lock

## Solution
Modified `ResourceLock.AcquireReadLockAsync()` to check if the transaction already holds the read lock and return immediately if it does:

```csharp
// If we already hold the read lock, return immediately
if (this.readLockHolders.Contains(transactionId))
{
    this.lockSemaphore.Release();
    semaphoreReleased = true;
    return true;
}
```

## Additional Fixes
1. Fixed style errors in `FileHelper.cs` (SA1513 - missing blank lines)
2. Fixed style errors in `WALTests.cs`:
   - Removed readonly modifiers from fields that needed reassignment
   - Added missing blank lines
   - Removed trailing whitespace
3. Fixed style errors in `AsyncTestBase.cs`:
   - Added missing XML documentation for return values and parameters
   - Removed trailing whitespace

## Results
- All tests now pass (343 passed, 5 skipped, 0 failed)
- Build successful with 0 warnings and 0 errors
- Updated investigation summary, design document, and implementation plan

## Key Takeaway
When implementing lock managers, always consider the case where a transaction might need to re-acquire a lock it already holds. This is a common pattern in database systems and should not cause deadlocks.
